## How I would Introduce this to the Platform Team at OmniSOC


First I would talk to Jeffrey, since OmniSOC/IU is pushing for more AI adoption I went and built an AI tool around infrastructure work and I would love for him to take a look and give some feedback.

It creates sandboxes from VMs and the Agent does work in these sandboxes, this work gets turned into an Ansible playbook that then can be approved by a human and applied to the production VM.

Installation takes a second with the Go API

## Updates

This would need to be setup, probably with a cli tool or something, not sure


## Friction

I'm sure there would be friction but that is friction that I can keep in mind.
